## Methodology

### Data Description and Preprocessing Pipeline

The preprocessing architecture employs a comprehensive PostsTableTransformation class. This step was focused on indetifying the language of the post, so that we can filter out non-english posts. It also removed all the HTML tags, and other artifacts that were present in the posts.

### Language Detection and Multilingual Content Handling

A critical preprocessing step involves language detection using the langdetect library, which implements that does the classification through a Naive Bayes classifier [gargova2022evaluation]. This choice was motivated by the international nature of blogging platforms during the early 2000s, where content could appear in multiple languages within the same dataset. The langdetect library was selected over alternatives such as spaCy's language detection due to its robust performance on short text segments, which is particularly relevant for blog posts that may contain brief entries or fragmented thoughts.

The language detection process incorporates several defensive programming strategies to handle edge cases common in blog data. Text segments shorter than three characters are automatically classified as "unknown" to prevent false positives, while content containing fewer than ten characters after cleaning is similarly filtered to ensure reliable detection accuracy. The cleaning process removes special characters and normalizes whitespace before language analysis, as the presence of HTML entities and formatting artifacts can significantly impact detection performance.


### Text Normalization and Cleaning Methodology

The text cleaning pipeline addresses specific artifacts common in early web content through a multi-stage normalization process. HTML entity decoding handles common entities such as &amp;, &lt;, &gt;, &quot;, &#39;, &ndash;, and &mdash; that frequently appear in blog content due to the HTML rendering processes of early blogging platforms. The removal of "urlLink" strings addresses a specific artifact pattern observed in the dataset where hyperlinks were replaced with placeholder text during the data collection process.

The whitespace normalization process consolidates multiple consecutive spaces into single spaces and removes leading/trailing whitespace, addressing formatting inconsistencies that arise from HTML-to-text conversion processes. This standardization is crucial for downstream tokenization accuracy, as irregular spacing patterns can lead to token boundary errors and artificially inflate vocabulary size [hacohen2020influence].

### Natural Language Processing Foundation

The core NLP preprocessing pipeline leverages the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) framework, chosen for its linguistic resource availability and ease of implementation [bird2006nltk]. The tokenization process uses NLTK's Punkt tokenizer, which divides a body of work into a series of sentences using their pre-trained model for English. Punkt can be highly accurate [sanchez2019sentence]. This is particularly valuable for blog content, which often contains non-standard punctuation, abbreviations, and formatting that can challenge rule-based tokenizers.

Stopword removal utilizes NLTK's "English" stopwords corpus, encompassing 179 common English words that typically carry minimal semantic weight in topic modeling contexts [yogish2019review]. Stopwords were removed in order to prioritize the most important words in the post, and to increase the chances of distinctinct topics being identified.

Lemmatization, the process of reducing words to their canonical forms, was implemented using NLTK's WordNetLemmatizer, which implements a morphological analysis approach based on the WordNet lexical database [khyani2021interpretation]. This choice over stemming algorithms such as Porter or Snowball stemming was motivated by industry use and the speed of the lemmatization process.

### Word Frequency Analysis and Feature Engineering

The word frequency computation implements term frequency (TF) analysis following classical information retrieval methodologies [?], serving as the foundation for subsequent TF-IDF vectorization processes. The frequency analysis incorporates configurable parameters for minimum word length (default: 2 characters) to filter out artifacts and abbreviations that may not contribute meaningful semantic information. The extraction of both most common and least common words provides insights into vocabulary distribution characteristics that inform optimal feature selection for topic modeling.

The frequency computation process addresses the challenge of hapax legomena (words appearing only once) by implementing filtering strategies that distinguish between meaningful rare terms and noise artifacts [?]. Least common word identification excludes single-occurrence terms to reduce noise while preserving genuinely rare but semantically valuable vocabulary items. This approach balances vocabulary coverage with computational efficiency, particularly important given the large scale of the dataset.

The implementation returns frequency analysis results as JSON-serialized data structures within the Polars DataFrame, enabling efficient storage and retrieval while maintaining compatibility with downstream topic modeling processes. This architectural choice facilitates the integration of frequency analysis results with subsequent TF-IDF vectorization and topic extraction methodologies without requiring expensive data transformation operations.

### Integration with Topic Extraction Methodologies

The preprocessing pipeline was specifically designed to support the dual topic extraction approaches outlined in the assignment requirements: TF-IDF-based topic identification and Transformer-Enhanced LDA modeling. The preservation of both cleaned content and word frequency information enables the TF-IDF approach to leverage pre-computed frequency statistics while maintaining access to full text content for transformer-based semantic analysis.

The choice to maintain separate content columns for original and translated text supports comparative analysis between language-specific and translated content topic extraction performance. This architectural decision acknowledges the potential semantic shifts that occur during machine translation, particularly for informal text containing cultural references, slang, and temporal linguistic markers common in early 2000s blog content [?].

The modular design of the PostsTableTransformation class enables incremental processing and experimentation with different preprocessing configurations without requiring complete pipeline reexecution. This flexibility is particularly valuable for iterative refinement of preprocessing parameters based on downstream topic modeling performance, supporting the experimental methodology required for comprehensive comparison between topic extraction approaches.

### Computational Considerations and Scalability

The preprocessing pipeline incorporates several design decisions motivated by computational efficiency constraints inherent in processing 19,320 individual blog files. The use of Polars' lazy evaluation framework defers computation until explicitly materialized, enabling query optimization and memory usage reduction compared to eager evaluation approaches [?]. This is particularly beneficial for demographic segmentation operations that require filtering and grouping operations across the entire dataset.

Batch processing implementation for translation operations addresses API rate limiting while maintaining reasonable processing throughput. The configurable batch size parameter allows for adaptation to different computational environments and API service constraints, ensuring robustness across varying deployment scenarios. Progress logging provides visibility into processing status for long-running operations, enabling monitoring and debugging of the preprocessing pipeline.

The integration of environment variable configuration (TOKENIZERS_PARALLELISM="false") addresses known compatibility issues between transformer libraries and multiprocessing environments common in computational text analysis workflows [?]. This configuration ensures stable execution across different hardware configurations while preventing race conditions that could corrupt preprocessing results.
